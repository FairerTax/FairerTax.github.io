            <p>
              <strong>
                The working class in America suffers heavily from the extreme
                wealth inequality. Replacing the current federal income tax with
                a progressive wealth tax could dramatically reduce the financial
                burden on lower- and middle-income families—by as much as
                90%—while generating substantially more revenue for the country.
                Based on current estimates, such a tax could raise approximately
                $4 trillion annually, compared to the $2 trillion collected
                through the existing income tax system.

            Currently, the working class suffers heavily from the rapidly
            widening wealth inequality. The adverse effects of having such
            drastic inequality includes inflation without wage growth, reduced
            availability of housing units, increasing rent and house prices,
            increasingly unaffordable healthcare and immense wealth influence
            over the government. The bottom 90% only holds 32.8% of the nation’s
            wealth while the top 10% holds roughly 67.2% of total net wealth
            ($107.5 trillion), and even further, the top 1% holds 30.8% of the
            wealth ($49.2 trillion), indicating significant concentration at the
            top.
